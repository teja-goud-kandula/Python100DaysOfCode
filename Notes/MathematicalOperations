7 + 2
5 - 3
2 * 3
6 / 2
2 ** 3 (Exponential)

Priority order is:
PEMDAS
Parentheses -> ()
Exponents -> **
Multiplication -> *
Division -> /
Addition -> +
Subtraction -> -

Multiplication and Division takes the same Priority. But they are executed from left to right.
Addition and Subtraction also takes the same Priority. But they are executed from left to right.


Ex : print (3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
Ans : 7

PEMDAS
Here we don't have any Parentheses and Exponents.
Then Multiplication and Division are present and they will be executed from left to right.
3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3 becomes
9     + 3 / 3 - 3 becomes
9     + 1.0   - 3 becomes

Then Addition and Subtraction are present and they will be executed from left to right.
9     + 1.0   - 3 becomes
10.0          - 3 becomes
7.

To understand how this code is being debugged by Python run this code on the #Thonny tool.


Floor Division:
8//3 -> 2

Here the decimals are chopped off and number is rounded off using a floor function.
type(8//3) -> int
type(4/2) -> float  (This is a normal division)
