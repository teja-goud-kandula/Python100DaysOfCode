score = 0  # int datatype
height = 1.8 # float datatype
isWinning = True # Boolean datatype

# To print the above 3 variables in a single print statement one has to use type conversion using str 3 times
# But by using f strings we can solve this
print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")


To write an f string place an f in the start of the string.
f strings eliminate a lot of the manual labour of type conversion
